# Mesocycle feature-set
A mesocycle is multiple microcycles (weeks) of training sequenced together.

## Mesocycle inputs
- Duration (generally 4-16 weeks)
- RIR progression (generally 3 RIR -> 0 RIR)
- Muscle group splitting (eg: PPL, Upper Lower, Full Body)
- Muscle group frequency per microcycle (generally 2-4 times per week)
- Exercise selection (rep ranges, sets, muscle targets)
- Volume guidelines (MV, MEV, MAV, MRV)
